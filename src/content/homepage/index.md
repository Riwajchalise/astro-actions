Mickey Mouse is an American cartoon character co-created in 1928 by [Walt Disney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney) and [Ub Iwerks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ub_Iwerks). The longtime icon and mascot of [The Walt Disney Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company), Mickey is an [anthropomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphic) mouse who typically wears red shorts, large yellow shoes, and white gloves. Inspired by such [silent film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film) personalities as [Charlie Chaplin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin) and [Douglas Fairbanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Fairbanks), Mickey is traditionally characterized as a sympathetic [underdog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underdog) who gets by on pluck and ingenuity in the face of challenges bigger than himself.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mouse#cite_note-2) The character’s depiction as a small mouse is personified through his diminutive stature and [falsetto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsetto) voice, the latter of which was originally provided by Disney. Mickey is one of the world's most recognizable and universally acclaimed fictional characters of all time.

Created as a replacement for a prior Disney character, [Oswald the Lucky Rabbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_the_Lucky_Rabbit), Mickey first appeared in the short [Plane Crazy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_Crazy), debuting publicly in the short film [Steamboat Willie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steamboat_Willie) (1928), while it was third cartoon featuring Mickey to be produced, it was also one of the first [sound cartoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_film). The character was originally to be named "Mortimer Mouse", until [Lillian Disney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillian_Disney) instead suggested "Mickey" during a train ride. The character went on to appear in over 130 films, including [The Band Concert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Band_Concert) (1935), [Brave Little Tailor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_Little_Tailor) (1938), and [Fantasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasia_\(1940_film\)) (1940). Mickey appeared primarily in short films, but also occasionally in feature-length films. Ten of Mickey's cartoons were nominated for the [Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Animated_Short_Film), one of which, [Lend a Paw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lend_a_Paw), won the award in [1941](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Academy_Awards). In 1978, Mickey became the first cartoon character to have a star on the [Hollywood Walk of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame).
