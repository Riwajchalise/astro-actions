The Simpsons is an American [animated sitcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animated_sitcom) created by [Matt Groening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Groening) for the [Fox Broadcasting Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons#cite_note-3)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons#cite_note-4)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons#cite_note-5) The series is a [satirical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire_\(film_and_television\)) depiction of American life, epitomized by the [Simpson family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson_family), which consists of [Homer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_Simpson), [Marge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marge_Simpson), [Bart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_Simpson), [Lisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Simpson), and [Maggie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Simpson). Set in the fictional town of [Springfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield_\(The_Simpsons\)), it caricatures society, Western culture, television, and the [human condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_condition).

The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of [animated shorts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons_shorts) with producer [James L. Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Brooks). He created a [dysfunctional family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysfunctional_family) and named the characters after his own family members, substituting Bart for his own name; he thought Simpson was a funny name in that it sounded similar to "[simpleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpleton)".[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons#cite_note-6) The shorts became a part of [The Tracey Ullman Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tracey_Ullman_Show) on April 19, 1987. After three seasons, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became Fox's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989–1990).

Since its debut on December 17, 1989, [750 episodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Simpsons_episodes) of the show have been broadcast. It is the [longest-running American animated series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest-running_United_States_television_series), [longest-running American sitcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest-running_U.S._primetime_television_series), and the [longest-running American scripted primetime television series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest-running_scripted_U.S._primetime_television_series), both in terms of seasons and number of episodes. A feature-length film, [The Simpsons Movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons_Movie), was released in theaters worldwide on July 27, 2007, and grossed over $527 million, with a sequel in development as of 2018. The series has also spawned numerous [comic book series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Simpsons_comics), [video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Simpsons_video_games), [books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Simpsons_books), and other related media, as well as a billion-dollar [merchandising industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons_\(franchise\)#Merchandise). The Simpsons is a joint production by [Gracie Films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracie_Films) and [20th Television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Television).[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons#cite_note-7)
